DEVELOPING: UE Dawn Editor-in-Chief Joshua Molo was allegedly forced to apologize in public for posting statements on Facebook against the Duterte administrationâ€™s response on the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is after Molo had an online argumentation with his high school teachers, who were "offended" by Molo's criticisms against President Rodrigo Duterte.

Friends of Molo, who were in contact with him during the incident, said that the barangay officials threatened to file a libel case against Molo should the latter refuse to apologize.

Molo was also threatened to be picked up by the police if he posts any statement against the government again.
