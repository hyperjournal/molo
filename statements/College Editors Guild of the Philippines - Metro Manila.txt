PRESS STATEMENT REGARDING THE ARREST, RED-TAGGING, AND THREAT OF UE DAWN’S EDITOR IN CHIEF

College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) Metro Manila strongly condemns the red-tagging and the arrest of University of the East (UE) Dawn Editor-in-Chief Joshua Molo after publishing critical opinion with regard to the Duterte administration’s response in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Molo was summoned by barangay officials in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija around 12:30 on Sunday, April 5, at the Barangay Hall. He was accompanied by his mother who is also an official in their barangay. Thereby, his Facebook account was then probed by police where red-tagging remarks instigated. Molo was made to issue a public apology after engaging in an online discussion with the alleged “offended” teachers.

According to him, the teacher threatened to file libel charges if Molo refused to apologize in public. He was also threatened to be picked up by police if he opted to publish any critical statements against the government further.

Intimidation, red-tagging, and proliferation of lies has worsened which curtailed the exercise of free speech and expression under President Rodrigo Duterte’s watch.

Given these attacks, the Guild also reiterates the suppression against the Today’s Carolinian EIC Berns Mitra of University of San Carlos (USC) after publishing an editorial on Facebook titled “A GOVERNOR IS NOT ABOVE THE CONSTITUTION” condemning the alleged intimidation of the governor against critics.

In the course of our struggle regarding free speech and expression, this affront is not new. Vilification efforts made upon silencing those who voice their dissent and opposition against the autocratic ruling of Duterte administration, we will continue this fight. Collectively, we will persevere.
