Today, April 5, 2020, UE Dawn Editor-in-chief Joshua B. Molo was forced to make a public apology on Facebook under the threat of a libel case from the barangay officials of San Fernando Sur, Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. The public apology was filmed in the Barangay Hall of San Fernando Sur, after Molo's criticism of his former high school teachers. He was to be charged with libel unless he agreed to issue a public apology and stop criticizing the government.

We, the members of KAMALAYAN, the official student publication of Malayan Colleges Laguna, believe that freedom of speech is an indispensable part of what makes the Philippines a democracy. It is a right enshrined in our constitution, which explicitly forbids any law that goes against our right to free speech and expression.

It is because of this that we condemn this move against UE Dawnâ€™s Editor-in-chief. This lowers the standard of how we, as a country, respect the rights given to us by our constitution. As a student publication, we stand firm in our belief that the freedom of speech and of the press is necessary to ensure that all other liberties are preserved.
