UE DAWN STATEMENT | We in the Dawn, the official student publication of the University of the East (UE), condemn in the strongest possible terms the recent actions against Joshua B. Molo, our Editor in Chief, who was forced to publicly apologize today, April 5, 2020, after barangay officials of San Fernando Sur, Cabiao, Nueva Ecija, threatened to file a libel case against him.

Molo, who had criticized some of his former high school teachers, was brought to the Barangay Hall of San Fernando Sur. He was then threatened with the filing of a libel case against him unless he issued a public apology and stopped criticizing the national government.

We must point out that, as stated in Article III, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines: No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.

Preventing someone from expressing his or her opinion on matters such as grievances against the government is an act of oppression. We, the members of the UE Dawn, strongly believe that to criticize the government is a right of every Filipino.
